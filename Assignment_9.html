<h1>Assignment 9 Instructions</h1>

Congratulations on all the work that you have done so far :)<br>
Now let's take a short break from our projects. <br>
Here we are testing our design pattern knowledge <br>
Remember, if there is anything here that you don't quite understand, please ask me  :) <br>

<h2>Question</h2>
In your groups, you choose between these two design patterns, the singleton pattern and the factory pattern <br>
After choosing one of these, explain it in your own words and write example code illustrating the concept. <br>
And if you feel that maybe you can use one of these in your project, feel free to do so but you are not required to.<br>
The documentation explaining the design pattern needs to be submitted as a PDF document.<br>
You will submit this PDF document together with a java project containing your example code.<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 100 marks <br>
The sample code is worth 80 marks, if your code does not run -20<br>
If your code does not implement the concept that is -80 <br>
The document is worth 20 marks, if the concept is not well explained that is -20 <br>
If the concept is partially explained -10 <br>

<h3>Attention</h3>
Here are a few things that can make you lose marks, please make sure that you note these things well :)<br>
If there is no author on the top of every page, that is -5, for every page that does not have an author on the top.<br>
If your read me does not describe in short what your project does,
and does not have the names of people in the group, that is -5 <br>
Remember to keep your code, well organized, well commented and clean.<br><br>

Go my African Giants, go get these hundreds, and remember to be safe :)<br>
<h3>Have fun :)</h3>
